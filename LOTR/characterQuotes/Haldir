`The name of Aragorn son of Arathorn is known in Lórien,'
`A dwarf! '
`You had no need of your burdens,'
`Celebrant is already a strong stream here, as you see,'
`No!'
'I do not doubt you,'
`You cannot go back,'
`Now let us cry: "
'You will have no claim,'
`Happy folk are Hobbits to dwell near the shores of the sea! '
`Not even to see fair Lothlórien? '
`Also,'
'Behold! You are come to Cerin Amroth,'
`There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood,'
'Here dwell Celeborn and Galadriel,'
`Come! '
`That is not well. We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days. They are not permitted in our land. I cannot allow him to pass.'

'and it runs both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it so far north, unless we must. But in these days of watchfulness we do not make bridges. This is how we cross! Follow me!'
`We have two more ropes. We will fasten them above the other, one shoulder-high, and another half-high, and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care.'
'Yet this is our law. I am not the master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have done much in letting you set foot over Celebrant.'
'Now you have come thus far, you must be brought before the Lord and the Lady. They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the rivers again, and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before you saw them.'
'A plague on Dwarves and their stiff necks! '
`I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and straight.'
`they bring me a message from the Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf Gimli. It seems that the Lady knows who and what is each member of your Company. New messages have come from Rivendell perhaps.'
`Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth? '
`Look this way first! '
`All is now ready for you. Enter the boats! But take care at first! '
