'I drew it forth,'
'Farewell then for a while!'
'You will find them in the Houses of Healing, and I will lead you thither,'
'We will come,'
'Then you would have us retreat to Minas Tirith, or Dol Amroth, or to Dunharrow, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?'
'As for me,'
'The Gate is destroyed,'
'And, maybe,'
'Where is the Steward? And where also is Mithrandir?'
'But the Lady Éowyn was yet living when they bore her hither. Did you not know?'

'the Lord Aragorn I hold to be my liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command. I will go also. Yet for a while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and it is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be given. For we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. Now, it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor must be protected. I would not have us return with victory to a City in ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the Rohirrim that there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.'

'Say not The Lords of Gondor. Say The King Elessar. For that is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the throne; and it will give the Enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name.'
