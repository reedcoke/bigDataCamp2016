'Do not be troubled. The tale shall wait. But I will give you a name, and I will call you Níniel, Tear-maiden.'
'Turambar is dead, but Níniel lives. Now it may be that she will come with me, and I will lead her away, and so we shall escape from the dragon together.'
'Is this the way?'
'The Black Sword was my beloved and my husband. To seek him only do I go. What else could you think?'
'Nay, lord, he is crazed. For he came here saying that you were dead, and he called it good tidings. But you live.'
'Tear-maiden'
