'The Mormegil cannot be slain, save by mischance, or an evil arrow from afar.'
'Evil have been all thy ways, son of Húrin. Thankless fosterling, outlaw, slayer of thy friend, thief of love, usurper of Nargothrond, captain foolhardy, and deserter of thy kin. As thralls thy mother and thy sister live in Dor-lómin, in misery and want. Thou art arrayed as a prince, but they go in rags; and for thee they yearn, but thou carest not for that. Glad may thy father be to learn that he hath such a son; as learn he shall.'
'Tell the Mormegil that Finduilas is here.'
'I also have been meshed in the doom of the Children of Húrin, and thus with my tidings have slain one that I loved.'
