'I am the Doorward of Théoden,'
'It is the will of Théoden,'
'This is the house of Théoden, not of Aragorn, even were he King of Gondor in the seat of Denethor,'
'Whatever its name may be,'
'Come, come!'
'The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age'
'Take back your sword, Éomer, sister-son!'
'In the House of Eorl,'
'What does that mean?'
'That Gandalf Greyhame has need of haste,'
'True enough,'
'Lord, hear me!'
'here you shall lay it, if you would not fight alone against all the men in Edoras.'
'Yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.'
'but for myself, I will wait until I see Gandalf again.'
's Deep!'
