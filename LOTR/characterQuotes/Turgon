'The Hidden Rock'
'I grudge you nothing that I have. Yet I desire that none shall dwell beyond my walls who know the way hither: and if I trust you, my sister, others I trust less to keep guard on their tongues.'
'I will not debate with you. Dark Elf. By the swords of the Noldor alone are your sunless woods defended. Your freedom to wander there wild you owe to my kin; and but for them long since you would have laboured in thraldom in the pits of Angband. And here I am King; and whether you will it or will it not, my doom is law. This choice only is given to you: to abide here, or to die here; and so also for your son.'
'Not long now can Gondolin be hidden; and being discovered it must fall.'
'Does Morgoth sleep? You were mistaken.'
'for they can bear but one meaning. Even HÃºrin Thalion has surrendered to the will of Morgoth. My heart is shut.'
