86 en Concerning Hobbits book largely concerned Hobbits pages reader may discover much character little history
87 en information will also found selection Red Book Westmarch already published title Hobbit
88 en story derived earlier chapters Red Book composed Bilbo first Hobbit become famous world large called Back since told journey East return adventure later involved Hobbits great events Age related
89 en Many however may wish know remarkable people outset may possess earlier book
90 en readers notes important points collected Hobbit-lore first adventure briefly recalled
91 en Hobbits unobtrusive ancient people numerous formerly today love peace quiet good tilled earth well-ordered well-farmed countryside favourite haunt
92 en understand like machines complicated forge-bellows water-mill hand-loom though skilful tools
93 en Even ancient days rule shy 'the Big Folk call us now avoid us dismay becoming hard find
94 en quick hearing sharp-eyed though inclined fat hurry unnecessarily nonetheless nimble deft movements
95 en possessed first art disappearing swiftly silently large folk wish meet come blundering developed Men may seem magical
96 en Hobbits never fact studied magic kind elusiveness due solely professional skill heredity practice close friendship earth rendered inimitable bigger clumsier races
97 en little people smaller Dwarves less tout stocky even actually much shorter
98 en height variable ranging two four feet measure
99 en seldom now reach three feet hive dwindled say ancient days taller
100 en According Red Book Bandobras Took Bullroarer son Isengrim Second four foot five able ride horse
101 en surpassed Hobbit records two famous characters old curious matter dealt book
102 en Hobbits Shire tales concerned days peace prosperity merry folk
103 en dressed bright colours notably fond yellow green seldom wore shoes since feet tough leathery soles clad thick curling hair much like hair heads commonly brown
104 en Thus craft little practised among shoe-making long skilful fingers make many useful comely things
105 en faces rule good-natured rather beautiful broad bright-eyed red-cheeked mouths apt laughter eating drinking
106 en laugh eat drink often heartily fond simple jests times six meals day get
107 en hospitable delighted parties presents gave away freely eagerly accepted
108 en plain indeed spite later estrangement Hobbits relatives ours far nearer us Elves even Dwarves
109 en old spoke languages Men fashion liked disliked much things Men
110 en exactly relationship can longer discovered
111 en beginning Hobbits lies far back Elder Days now lost forgotten
112 en Elves still preserve records vanished time traditions concerned almost entirely history Men appear seldom Hobbits mentioned
113 en Yet clear Hobbits fact lived quietly Middle-earth many long years folk became even aware
114 en world full strange creatures beyond count little people seemed little importance
115 en days Bilbo Frodo heir suddenly became wish important renowned troubled counsels Wise Great
116 en days Third Age Middle-earth now long past shape lands changed regions Hobbits lived doubtless still linger North-West Old World east Sea
117 en original home Hobbits Bilbo time preserved knowledge
118 en love learning genealogical lore far general among remained still older families studied books even gathered reports old times distant lands Elves Dwarves Men
119 en records began settlement Shire ancient legends hardly looked back Wandering Days

124 en crossing mountains Hobbits already become divided three somewhat different breeds Harfoots Stoors Fallohides
125 en Harfoots browner skin smaller shorter beardless bootless hands feet neat nimble preferred highlands hillsides
126 en Stoors broader heavier build feet hands larger preferred flat lands riversides
127 en Fallohides fairer skin also hair taller slimmer others lovers trees woodlands
128 en Harfoots much Dwarves ancient times long lived foothills mountains
129 en moved westward early roamed Eriador far Weathertop others still Wilderland

134 en Fallohides least numerous northerly branch
135 en friendly Elves Hobbits skill language song handicrafts old preferred hunting tilling
136 en crossed mountains north Rivendell came River Hoarwell
137 en Eriador soon mingled kinds preceded somewhat bolder adventurous often found leaders chieftains among clans Harfoots Stoors
138 en Even Bilbo time strong Fallohidish strain still noted among greater families Tooks Masters Buckland
139 en westlands Eriador Misty Mountains Mountains Lune Hobbits found Men Elves
140 en Indeed remnant still dwelt Dúnedain kings Men came Sea Westernesse dwindling fast lands North Kingdom falling far wide waste
141 en room spare incomers ere long Hobbits began settle ordered communities
142 en earlier settlements long disappeared forgotten Bilbo time one first become important still endured though reduced size Bree Chetwood lay round forty miles east Shire
143 en early days doubtless Hobbits learned letters began write manner Dúnedain turn long learned art Elves
144 en days also forgot whatever languages used spoke ever Common Speech Westron named current lands kings Arnor Gondor coasts Sea Belfalas Lune
145 en Yet kept words well names months days great store personal names past
146 en time legend among Hobbits first becomes history reckoning years

151 en western Hobbits fell love new land remained soon passed history Men Elves
152 en still king name subjects fact ruled chieftains meddled events world outside
153 en last battle Fornost Witch-lord Angmar sent bowmen aid king maintained though tales Men record
154 en war North Kingdom ended Hobbits took land chose chiefs Thain hold authority king gone
155 en thousand years little troubled wars prospered multiplied Dark Plague S.R

165 en last battle story opens indeed one ever fought within borders Shire beyond living memory Battle Greenfields S.R

167 en Even weathers grown milder wolves come ravening North bitter white winters now grandfather tale
168 en though still store weapons Shire used mostly trophies hanging hearths walls gathered museum Michel Delving
169 en Mathom-house called anything Hobbits immediate use unwilling throw away called mathom
170 en dwellings apt become rather crowded mathoms many presents passed hand hand sort
171 en Nonetheless ease peace left people still curiously tough
172 en came difficult daunt kill perhaps unwearyingly fond good things least put without survive rough handling grief foe weather way astonished know well looked bellies well-fed faces
173 en Though slow quarrel sport killing nothing lived doughty bay need still handle arms
174 en shot well bow keen-eyed sure mark
175 en bows arrows
176 en Hobbit stooped stone well get quickly cover trespassing beasts knew well
177 en Hobbits originally lived holes ground believed dwellings still felt home course time obliged adopt forms abode
178 en Actually Shire Bilbo days rule richest poorest Hobbits maintained old custom
179 en poorest went living burrows primitive kind mere holes indeed one window none well-to-do still constructed luxurious versions simple diggings old
180 en suitable sites large ramifying tunnels smials called everywhere found flats low-lying districts Hobbits multiplied began build ground
181 en Indeed even hilly regions older villages Hobbiton Tuckborough chief township Shire Michel Delving White Downs now many houses wood brick stone
182 en specially favoured millers smiths ropers cartwrights others sort even holes live
183 en Hobbits long accustomed build sheds workshops
184 en habit building farmhouses barns said begun among inhabitants Marish Brandywine
185 en Hobbits quarter Eastfarthing rather large heavy-legged wore dwarf-boots muddy weather
186 en well known Stoors large part blood indeed shown many grew chins
187 en Harfoot Fallohide trace beard
188 en Indeed folk Marish Buckland east River afterwards occupied came part later Shire south-away still many peculiar names strange words found elsewhere Shire
189 en probable craft building many crafts beside derived Dúnedain
190 en Hobbits may learned direct Elves teachers Men youth
191 en Elves High Kindred yet forsaken Middle-earth dwelt still time Grey Havens away west places within reach Shire
192 en Three Elf-towers immemorial age still seen Tower Hills beyond western marches
193 en shone far moonlight
194 en tallest furthest away standing alone upon green mound
195 en Hobbits Westfarthing said one see Sea lop tower Hobbit ever known climb
196 en Indeed Hobbits ever seen sailed upon Sea fewer still ever returned report
197 en Hobbits regarded even rivers small boats deep misgivings many swim
198 en days Shire lengthened spoke less less Elves grew afraid distrustful dealings Sea became word fear among token death turned faces away hills west
199 en craft building may come Elves Men Hobbits used fashion
200 en go towers
201 en houses usually long low comfortable
202 en oldest kind indeed built imitations smials thatched dry grass straw roofed turves walls somewhat bulged

206 en Bilbo Frodo Baggins bachelors exceptional also many ways friendship Elves
207 en Sometimes case Tooks Great Smials Brandybucks Brandy Hall many generations relatives lived comparative peace together one ancestral many-tunnelled mansion

215 en Concerning Pipe-weed another astonishing thing Hobbits old must mentioned astonishing habit imbibed inhaled pipes clay wood smoke burning leaves herb called pipe-weed leaf variety probably Nicotiana
216 en great deal mystery surrounds origin peculiar custom 'art Hobbits preferred call
217 en discovered antiquity put together Meriadoc Brandybuck later Master Buckland since tobacco Southfarthing play part history follows remarks introduction Herblore Shire may quoted
218 en ‘This says 'is one art can certainly claim invention
219 en Hobbits first began smoke known legends family histories take granted ages folk Shire smoked various herbs fouler sweeter
220 en accounts agree Tobold Hornblower Longbottom Southfarthing first grew true pipe-weed gardens days Isengrim Second year 1070 Shire-reckoning

225 en thus quite possible learned plant Bree now rate grows well south slopes hill
226 en Bree-hobbits claim first actual smokers pipe-weed
227 en claim course done everything people Shire refer `` colonists '' case claim think likely true
228 en certainly Bree art smoking genuine weed spread recent centuries among Dwarves folk Rangers Wizards wanderers still passed fro ancient road-meeting
